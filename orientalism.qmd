## What do this scholarship do?

Spans:

1.  Humanities
2.  Social sciences
3.  Social/critical theory

## What does this scholarship do?

1.  Exegesis (tafsīr?) of Said
2.  Postcolonial theory
3.  Literary criticism

## What does this scholarship not do

1.  Quantify trends in Orientalism over time (/test if Said was right!)

This despite:

1.  Rise of digital humanities
2.  Rise of quantitative techniques for analyzing semantic content of texts

## What do I do?

-   Data:
    -   Google Books corpus: English (fic. + non-fic.), French (fic. + non-fic.), English (fic. only)
    -   Embeddings from Hamilton et al. (2018) [`HistWords`](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/histwords/) project trained with GloVe algorithm

## What is a word embedding?

|       | Dimension 1 | Dimension 2 | Dimension 3 |
|-------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| king  | 1.2         | 0.7         | -0.3        |
| queen | 1.1         | 0.8         | -0.2        |
| man   | 1.0         | -0.2        | 0.9         |
| woman | 0.9         | -0.1        | 1.0         |

...but bigger than this

## Component parts

The PMI is defined by the following formula:

$$
\text{PMI} = \log\left(\frac{P(x,y)}{P(x) \cdot P(y)}\right)
$$

Where:

-   $P(x,y)$ is the probability of word $x$ appearing within a six-word window of word `y`
-   $P(x)$ is the probability of word `x` appearing in the whole corpus
-   $P(y)$ is the probability of word `y` appearing in the whole corpus

## Word embeddings with GloVe

After we've generated our term (feature) co-ocurrence matrix

```{r, eval = F, echo = T}
WINDOW_SIZE <- 6
DIM <- 300
ITERS <- 100

glove <- GlobalVectors$new(rank = DIM, 
                           x_max = 100,
                           learning_rate = 0.05)
                           
wv_main <- glove$fit_transform(toks_fcm, n_iter = ITERS,
                               convergence_tol = 1e-3, 
                               n_threads = parallel::detectCores()) # set to 'parallel::detectCores()' to use all available cores

wv_context <- glove$components
local_glove <- wv_main + t(wv_context) # word vectors
```

## Back to Said...

We are working with these:

|       | Dimension 1 | Dimension 2 | Dimension 3 |
|-------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| king  | 1.2         | 0.7         | -0.3        |
| queen | 1.1         | 0.8         | -0.2        |
| man   | 1.0         | -0.2        | 0.9         |
| woman | 0.9         | -0.1        | 1.0         |

But we have these over every decade 1800-2010 trained on the entirety of Google Books (tens of millions of published works).

## So why are these useful?

-   Allow us to look at relationship *between* words
    -   "we shall know a word by the company it keeps" (Firth, 1957)
-   Allow us to understand relatinship *between* words *over time*
    -   has made possible a number of important articles excavating over-time trends in bias and prejudice...

## Estimation procedure

-   Same as in articles by Manzini et al. (2018) and Charlesworth et al. (2022)
    -   Mean average cosine similarity (MAC) implemented in `sweater` R package by Chung-hong Chan.

## Estimation procedure

$$
MAC = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \frac{\mathbf{A}_i \cdot \mathbf{B}_i}{||\mathbf{A}_i|| \cdot ||\mathbf{B}_i||}
$$

Where:

-   $\mathbf{A}_i$ and $\mathbf{B}_i$ are the i-th pair of vectors from the two sets.

-   $\mathbf{A}_i \cdot \mathbf{B}_i$ is the dot product of the vectors.

-   $||\mathbf{A}_i||$ and $||\mathbf{B}_i||$ are the magnitudes of the vectors.

-   $N$ is the total number of vector pairs.

## Seed words

Select four dimensions based on secondary scholarship + close reading:

1.  Exoticism
2.  Irrationality
3.  Despotism
4.  Eroticism

Expand using `gensim` of Google News corpus + manual classification.

## For each set of words:

Calculate cosine similarity between the word "Arab" and each individual word in each dimension.

```{r, eval = F, echo = T}
S1 <- exotic_strange_words
A1 <- c("arab")

P_all <- data.frame(matrix(ncol=0, nrow=length(S1)))
for (i in seq_along(wordvecs.dat)) {

  embedding <- as.matrix(wordvecs.dat[[i]])
  x <- mac(embedding, S1, A1) #this function calculates MAC

  P <- as.data.frame(x$P)
  colnames(P) <- decade_names[[i]]
  P_all <- cbind(P_all, P)
}

```

## For each set of words:

```{r, eval = F, echo = T}
P_all <- P_all %>%
  rownames_to_column("word")

P_all_long <- P_all %>% gather(year, value, -c("word"))
P_all_long$year <- as.numeric(P_all_long$year)

# this section is essentially doing what `mac_es()` would do if called in loop
P_all_mean <- P_all_long %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarise(mean_sim = mean(value, na.rm = T), #note: averaging across non-NA values
            word = "average")
```

## Intepretation

- “I have already lost, Kingdom after Kingdom, province after province, the more beautiful half of the universe, and soon I will know of no place in which I can find a refuge for my dreams; but it is Egypt that I most regret having driven out of my imagination, now that I have sadly placed it in my memory.” (Nerval, cited in Said 1978, 100)

- “Unable to recognize "its" Orient in the new Third World, Orientalism now faced a challenging and politically armed Orient...” (Said 1978, 104)

## Future directions

-   Change point analyses
-   French corpus
-   External validity
-   Alternative dimensions (?)
